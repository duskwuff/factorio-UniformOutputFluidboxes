Uniform Output Fluidboxes
=========================

Makes output fluidboxes on assemblers have an maximum area of 1.

This mitigates an issue in Space Exploration where some fluid assemblers will
build up unusually large amounts of product in their outputs, consuming more
ingredients than the player may have intended.

This *may* reduce production slightly in some high-throughput scenarios in SE.
